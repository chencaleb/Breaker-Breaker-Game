#BREAKER BREAKER Version 1.0 02/04/2015

Breaker Breaker is a simple web application that mimics the classic arcade game Brick Breaker aka Arkanoid. The objective of the game is to destroy all of the bricks with the moving ball. Moving the paddle allows one to bounce the ball around the board. If the ball gets past the paddle bottom line you lose. One can restart the game by simply pressing Play Again.

##Project Planning and Build

This was planned via Trello. I've also included the initial wire frames here: http://imgur.com/rNvQut0. Though I did not utilize the pizza theme for version 1.0, I plan on iterating for version 2.0.

The app was built utilizing JavaScript and jQuery as well as Bootstrap elements.
